# üé≤ Megapoly - Game
This is a game developed with Java and Java Swing. It is based on the popular board game 'Monopoly' and can be played by 2 players.

For this project, I decided to create Megapoly with a theme centered around Europe. In this game, the streets will represent European countries. 
For the design of the board and screens, I used the application 'Canva.' The game consists of 3 screens: the home screen, the new game screen, and the game board.

 * **Home screen:**

</br>
On the right side of the board, there are panels that display the players' information. 
This includes each player's name, the money they have, and the properties they have acquired during the game. 
</br>
In the center of the board, there is a yellow panel that collects information about transactions, the names of the spaces, and other relevant information to understand the game. 
To its left, there is a label indicating whose turn it is, along with two buttons to roll and move the piece. 
The 'Mostrar/Ocultar Men√∫' button located at the top center of the board has the functionality to show or hide the menu at the top.

<br>
These classes are fundamental for the functioning of our application, and each class has different attributes that we will use throughout the game. <br>
* The 'Jugador' class stores the necessary data for the players. <br>
* The 'Tablero' class allows us to create the board, which is made up of spaces.<br>
* The classes 'Calle,' 'Carcel,' 'Impuesto' 'Parking,' and 'Suerte' represent different types of spaces in the game. All of them inherit from 'Casillas'. <br>
* The classes 'PantallaInicio,' 'PantallaNuevaPartida,' and 'PantallaTablero' are key elements in the user interface. <br>
* The 'GameBoardScreen' class contains all the logical methods that are essential for the correct functioning of the game.
